This project is concerned with building the strongest network of technical service blocking attacks over the Internet through software that automatically clones all drives connected to the device and then implants it inside external disks and spreads it like an epidemic that exploits some gaps in devices and networks such as FTP, SSH and others...

- The project is under construction and the expected time for completion is within one year due to insufficient time.
